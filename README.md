 Adaptive Chatbot Project Project Overview The Adaptive Chatbot Project provides a simple yet interactive chatbot that learns from its interactions with users. Using a JSON-backed data store, the chatbot can dynamically update its knowledge base with new questions and responses based on user inputs, making it more effective over time. This project is ideal for those looking to implement a basic AI chatbot that can evolve and adapt through user engagement.  Features Dynamic Learning: The chatbot updates its responses database (chatbot_data.json) whenever it encounters a question it doesn't already know, by asking the user for the appropriate response. Persistent Knowledge Base: All interactions and the evolving knowledge base are saved in JSON format, allowing the chatbot to retain and reuse learned information across sessions. Chat History Logging: Each session's interactions are logged in a text file (chat_history.txt), providing a record of all conversations that can be reviewed for improvements or debugging. Simple Interaction Model: Users interact with the chatbot via a command-line interface, making it accessible and easy to use for demonstrations or educational purposes. Getting Started Prerequisites Python 3.x Basic familiarity with Python and JSON file handling Installation and Setup Clone the Repository: bash Copy code git clone https://github.com/yourusername/adaptive-chatbot.git cd adaptive-chatbot Running the Chatbot: bash Copy code python chatbot.py Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the chatbot. If the chatbot encounters an unknown question, it will ask for an appropriate response to learn from. Contributing Contributions to the Adaptive Chatbot Project are welcome! Whether it involves refining the learning algorithms, enhancing the user interface, or improving the documentation, your input is valued. Please feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests, or open issues for bugs you may find or features you think would be beneficial.
